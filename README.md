# EurorackPower

A submodule PCB for prototyping Eurorack modules. This PCB encapsulates the circuit often used in Eurorack modules for reverse polarity protection and ripple filtering. This PCB can be mounted onto another PCB or onto a breadboard.

It conforms to a system of submodules I am developing to make prototyping a little bit easier and more modular. Yeah, modular in your modular.
